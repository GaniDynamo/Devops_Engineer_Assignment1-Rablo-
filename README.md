<h1>üì¶ DevOps Engineer Assignment 1: S3 to RDS/Glue Data Pipeline CI/CD</h1>

This repository contains the complete solution for the DevOps Engineer Assignment, demonstrating a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a containerized data processing application to AWS using Jenkins and Terraform.

<h2>üöÄ Architecture and Process Flow</h2>

The solution leverages a decoupled Terraform deployment within the Jenkins pipeline to successfully resolve the circular dependency where the AWS Lambda function requires an image that only the ECR repository (created by Terraform) can host.

Stage

Tool

Description

1. Infra Prerequisites

Terraform (Targeted Apply)

Creates the necessary AWS resources before the image build: ECR Repository, S3 Bucket, IAM Role, and RDS Subnet Group.

2. Build & Push Image

Docker / AWS CLI

Authenticates Docker with ECR, builds the Python application image, tags it (latest, build number), and pushes it to the ECR repository.

3. Final Deployment

Terraform (Full Apply)

Runs the final deployment, creating the AWS Lambda function and referencing the image that is now available in ECR.

Details

Jenkinsfile

CI/CD Pipeline

Groovy script defining the 4-stage automated deployment process. Crucial for dependency resolution.

main.tf

Infrastructure as Code

HCL definition for all AWS resources, including aws_ecr_repository.repo, aws_s3_bucket.data_bucket, aws_db_instance.rds, aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role, and aws_lambda_function.my_lambda.

s3_to_rds_glue.py

Application Logic

Python script to read from S3, attempt to insert data into PostgreSQL RDS, and fallback to writing to Glue Data Catalog upon failure.

Dockerfile

Containerization

Defines the image environment (python:3.9-slim), installs boto3 and psycopg2-binary dependencies, and packages the application script.

<h2>‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Resources Deployed</h2>

The Terraform configuration creates the following resources in the us-east-1 region:

ECR Repository: s3-to-rds-glue-pipe

S3 Bucket: rablo-bucket-pipe-2804

RDS Subnet Group: rablo-rds-pipe1-subnet-group

IAM Role: lambda-exec-role-pipe1 (Lambda Execution Role)

AWS Lambda: s3_to_rds_glue_lambda-pipe1 (Container-based function)

RDS Instance: PostgreSQL database instance.

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Execution</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

A running Jenkins instance.

AWS CLI installed on the Jenkins agent.

Terraform CLI installed on the Jenkins agent.

Docker installed on the Jenkins agent.

An AWS IAM Role configured with necessary permissions (ECR, Lambda, S3, RDS, Glue).

An AWS Credentials entry in Jenkins named aws-credential-id.

<h3>Running the Pipeline</h3>

In Jenkins, create a New Item of type Pipeline.

Configure the pipeline to use "Pipeline script from SCM" (Git).

Set the Repository URL to: https://github.com/GaniDynamo/Devops_Engineer_Assignment1-Rablo-.git

Set the Branch Specifier to main.

Save and click Build Now.

The Jenkins pipeline will automatically clone the repository and execute the four deployment stages defined in the Jenkinsfile.
