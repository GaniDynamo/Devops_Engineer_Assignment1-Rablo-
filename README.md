<h1>üì¶ DevOps Engineer Assignment 1: S3 to RDS/Glue Data Pipeline CI/CD</h1>

This repository contains the complete solution for the DevOps Engineer Assignment, demonstrating a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a containerized data processing application to AWS using Jenkins and Terraform.

<h2>üöÄ Architecture and Process Flow</h2>

The CI/CD solution, orchestrated by Jenkins, uses a decoupled Terraform deployment strategy to resolve the critical circular dependency between the ECR repository creation and the Lambda function deployment.

The pipeline is structured into four main stages:

Stage 1: Infra Prerequisites (Targeted Terraform Apply): Creates foundational AWS resources (ECR Repository, S3 Bucket, IAM Role, and RDS Subnet Group), intentionally skipping the dependent Lambda function.

Stage 2: Authenticate with AWS and ECR: Performs Docker login authentication against the newly created ECR registry.

Stage 3: Build & Push Docker Image: Builds the application's container image, tags it, and pushes it to ECR.

Stage 4: Final Deployment (Full Terraform Apply): Executes the full Terraform configuration, which successfully creates the AWS Lambda function because its required ECR image is now available.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Repository Contents</h2>

The project relies on four core files for infrastructure, application logic, and deployment:

Jenkinsfile (CI/CD Orchestration): This Groovy script defines the multi-stage, dependency-aware pipeline execution logic.

main.tf (Infrastructure as Code): This HCL file defines all required AWS resources, including ECR, RDS, Lambda, S3, and IAM roles.

s3_to_rds_glue.py (Application Logic): This Python script is designed to read data from S3, attempt a data insert to PostgreSQL RDS, and implement a fallback to Glue Data Catalog if the RDS operation is not possible.

Dockerfile (Containerization): This file packages the application, installing necessary Python libraries (boto3, psycopg2-binary) onto a python:3.9-slim base image.

<h2>‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Resources Deployed (us-east-1)</h2>

The Terraform configuration provisions the following key resources:

ECR Repository: s3-to-rds-glue-pipe (Container Image Host)

S3 Bucket: rablo-bucket-pipe-2804 (Source Data Storage)

RDS Subnet Group: rablo-rds-pipe1-subnet-group (Required for RDS instance)

RDS Instance: PostgreSQL database instance

IAM Role: lambda-exec-role-pipe1 (Lambda Execution Role)

AWS Lambda: s3_to_rds_glue_lambda-pipe1 (Container-based application function)

<h2>‚úÖ Deployment Proof (Screenshots)</h2>

Below are visual proofs confirming the end-to-end success of the CI/CD pipeline and the resulting infrastructure deployment.

<h3 align="center">1. Jenkins Successful Pipeline Execution</h3>

This image confirms that all four stages‚Äîfrom infrastructure creation to the final deployment‚Äîcompleted successfully.

<h3 align="center">2. ECR Repository Verification</h3>

This shows the ECR repository was created by Terraform and the application image was successfully pushed by Docker in the pipeline.

<h3 align="center">3. AWS Lambda Function Verification</h3>

Proof that the container-based Lambda function was created, referencing the ECR image URI.

<h3 align="center">4. Lambda Test Execution Output</h3>

Output showing the Lambda function was tested and confirmed the S3 data processing and connection to RDS or Glue.

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Execution</h2>

<h3 align="left">Prerequisites on Jenkins Agent</h3>

The Jenkins build agent must have the following tools installed and configured:

A running Jenkins instance.

AWS CLI and Terraform CLI.

Docker installed and running.

A pre-configured AWS IAM Role with permissions for ECR, Lambda, S3, RDS, and Glue actions.

An AWS Credentials entry in Jenkins named aws-credential-id for pipeline access.

<h3 align="left">Running the Pipeline</h3>

In the Jenkins dashboard, create a New Item and select the Pipeline project type.

In the pipeline configuration, choose "Pipeline script from SCM" (Git).

Set the Repository URL to: https://github.com/GaniDynamo/Devops_Engineer_Assignment1-Rablo-.git

Ensure the Branch Specifier is set to main.

Save the configuration and click Build Now.

The Jenkins pipeline will automatically clone the repository and execute the four defined deployment stages, managing infrastructure and application deployment end-to-end.
